Things to do:
1- Make 'dump_csv_from_db.py' work. Currently, with the new schema, we cannot go one level deeper into the _Value classes and read the actual values.
2- Check if the new bug fix on TemrinusDB helps us with creating Enumerations.
3- Update the ScopedValues with Dates instead of Star/end and new cofidence values and Unknown and all.
4- Update the list of properties. The list we have now does not include many of the properties on Equinox_2020
